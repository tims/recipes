Borscht
=======

Rys taught me how to make this. It's tasty.
Borscht is a beetroot, onion and cabbage soup.

Great peasant food.


Ingredients
-----------

* 4 or 5 red onions.
* A couple of cloves of garlic.
* Beetroot. Don't use tinned beetroot. Use either: 1 bunch of fresh beetroot or 4 packs (with 4 beets per pack) of pre-boiled beetroot.
* A savoy cabbage (or any cabbage would do).
* 1 bay leaf.
* 1 vegetable stock cube.
* A nob of butter.

Optional:

* A pack of ravioli.
* Sour cream.
* Dill for garnish.

Instructions
------------

If using fresh beetroot, boil them in a pot two hours beforehand until soft. This should take about an hour. Take them out of the water to cool and keep the water aside for later.

Thinly slice the red onions and fry them in a nob of butter. Cut up the garlic and add it to the onions.

Slice the cabbage as thin as possible. When the onions are soft mix the cabbage in.

If you're using pre-boiled packaged beetroot, empty the water in the packet into the soup. If using fresh beetroot, add some of the beetroot water you saved earlier. Slice the beetroot into thin strips and add when the cabbage has reduced.

Add more water to get the desired soup or broth consistency. 
Add the bay leaf and vegetable stock cube and mix in, let it stew for a while.

Done. Serve hot. You can freeze the leftovers and reheat whenever.

If you're being fancy and have a very soupy soup, you can add a pack of Ravioli and boil it in the soup until done. For garnish add a dollop of sour cream and sprinkle with dill.
