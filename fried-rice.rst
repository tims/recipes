=============================

Teriyaki sauce
==============

Ingredients
-----------

* Ginger.
* Garlic.
* A table spoon or so of brown sugar.
* Soy sauce.
* A dash of lemon juice.
* Water.
* A bit of mirin would be good.

Instructions
------------

* Fry the ginger, garlic (in a tiny bit of oil?).
* Add the brown sugar and soy sauce and stir until the sugar has dissolved.
* Add the mirin if you have it.
* Add some lemon juice if you feel like it. 
* Add some water simmer for a bit while stirring.

Put the teriyaki sauce aside and reuse the pan for the rice without cleaning it.

Fried Rice
==========

Ingredients
-----------

* Tofu. 
* Brown rice.
* Red onions (1 or 2).
* Half a cabbage.
* 3 or so carrots.
* A cup or so of peas.

Instructions
------------

Cut the tofu into cubes and soak it in the teriyaki sauce.

Boil some brown rice in a saucepan.

Cut the carrots into pea sized cubes and microwave for 5 minutes or so until soft.

Fry the onions in the pan used for the teriyaki.

Chop the cabbage thinly and add to the pan, mixing until it reduces a bit.
Add the carrots, peas and rice and mix in. Keep on the heat.

Push the mix to one side and scramble the eggs in space, then mix them into the rice and vegetables.

Keep frying and mixing occasionally.

In a saucepan (probably the one you used for the rice), add some oil and the marinated tofu. Add the rest of the teriyaki sauce to the fried rice.

When the tofu is golden, serve the tofu atop the fried rice. Ta daa.
