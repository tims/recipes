Spinach and Ricotta Pie
=======================

Ingredients
-----------

* 150g (1 bag or so) per person of washed baby spinach leaves.
* 1 tub of ricotta cheese per person.
* 1 red onion per person.
* 1 clove or so of garlic per person.

Optional

* Poppy seeds if you have them.
* A egg per person to help it set faster, you don't really need it though.

The sauce

* Tomato passata
* splash of white wine, or a teaspoon of sugar.

Instructions
------------

Essentially, this is just mix the 4 ingredients together and bake it. 


In detail:

Turn the over on to pre heat it about 180 ish.

Add a tiny bit of oil to a large fry pan (it needs to fit everything in it, you could probably just use a saucepan and reuse it for the passata later) and turn the heat on. Slice the onions thinly and add to the pan.

Crush and or slice the garlic and add to the pan. Stir frequently so they don't burn. Cook them until they're soft and starting to brown. 

Add the spinach to the pan, (probably in batches so it will fit) and let it reduce to it's natural wilted / mushy state, mixing it in with the onions.

Add the ricotta cheese and mix it in well. Should probably have the heat down a bit and just keep mixing for a while. You can add an egg or two so it will set quicker in the oven, if you do mix it in fast so that it doesn't start to cook before it's mixed in. 

Put this mix in a baking tray and sprinkle poppy seeds over the top. Bake until it doesn't wobble and is brown on top. If it browns, but is still wobbly, turn the heat down. 

While it's baking, heat the passata in a saucepan and boil it till it thickens a bit, you'll have to stir it a lot so that it doesn't spit everywhere. Add the wine or sugar to sweeten it a bit.

Serve the passata on top of the ricotta pie, with some greens and balsamic on the side.

You could also use the spinach ricotta mix in a proper pie, with pastry and all.
