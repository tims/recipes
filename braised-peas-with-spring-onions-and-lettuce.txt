This is my version of a classic French dish and, apart from it being delicious, what I love about it is that you can make it in literally a few minutes from start to finish. And I can guarantee you that practically everyone who turns their nose up at having some lettuce in with their peas ends up being converted.

Slowly heat the butter and a good lug of olive oil in a pan. Add the flour and stir around, then slowly pour in the stock. Turn up the heat and add the spring onions, peas and lettuce with a pinch of salt and pepper. Put the lid on and simmer for 5 minutes or until tender. Taste, correct the seasoning and squeeze in a little lemon juice. Serve drizzled with a splash of good oil. Itâ€™s fantastic served with a piece of fish.
